# Simple Graph

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-l3a7jq)

<h4>Notes on missing parts and assumptions:</h4>
- Configuration can be found on conf/index.ts
- No unit / E2E tests.
- Left part width containing labels should be calculated dynamically, alternatively the labels could be on the right
- Missing logic to scale the chart properly, it works for the existing proportions.
- Xaxis logic is not responsive and not fully implemented to be calculated dynamically.
- Used lodash for some quick and dirty data retrieval, could use native JS of course
