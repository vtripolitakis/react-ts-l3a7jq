<h4>Notes on missing parts and assumptions:</h4>
      <pre>- Configuration can be found on conf/index.ts</pre>
      <pre>- No unit / E2E tests.</pre>
      <pre>
        - Left part width containing labels should be calculated dynamically,
        alternatively the labels could be on the right
      </pre>
      <pre>
        - Missing logic to scale the chart properly, it works for the existing
        proportions.
      </pre>
      <pre>
        - Xaxis logic is not responsive and not fully implemented to be
        calculated dynamically.
      </pre>
      <pre>
        - Used lodash for some quick and dirty data retrieval, could use native
        JS of course
      </pre>
